Just 20,000 new jobs were created last month
against expectations of a 180,000 increase,
official figures show.
It is the lowest growth in non-farm payrolls
since September 2017 when employment was
affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
However, the small rise followed a sharp
 increase in new jobs in January, which was
revised up to 311,000.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist Pantheon
Macroeconomics, said that the expectation for
180,000 new positions in February was too high
because the figures at the beginning of the
year doubled-counted government workers who
took second jobs during the US Government
shutdown.
