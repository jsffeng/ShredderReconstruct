Raheem Sterling's hat-trick for Manchester
City on Saturday gave Pep Guardiola's side a
3-1 win over Watford and left the defending
champions with a four-point advantage.
Guardiola said it would be "almost impossible"
to win every remaining league match and all
Liverpool can do is win their own games and
hope for a slip-up from City.
The hosts made the worst possible start,
trailing early on, but Klopp's team responded
in fine fashion and showed their character to
dig deep and overcome a hard-working and
determined Burnley outfit.
