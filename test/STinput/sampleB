Nasa hopes to bring this near-eight year
gap in capability to an end with the
introduction of two new commercial systems
- the Dragon and another vehicle being
developed by aerospace giant Boeing.
The first crewed flight of the Dragon
could occur as soon as July, although
this target date is likely to slip into
the summer as engineers work through the
post-flight analysis.
Splashdown occurred at about 08:45 EST
(13:45 GMT). A boat, called GO Searcher,
was waiting to recover the capsule. There
were cheers at mission control as the
capsule landed in the Atlantic.
