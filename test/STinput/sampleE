Guardiola said it would be "almost impossible"
to win every remaining league match and all
Liverpool can do is win their own games and
hope for a slip-up from City.
The hosts made the worst possible start,
trailing early on, but Klopp's team responded
in fine fashion and showed their character to
dig deep and overcome a hard-working and
determined Burnley outfit.
Firmino's shot was deflected over after 13
minutes, but six minutes later he had his 10th
league goal of the season, scoring from close
range after a mistake from Heaton following
fine play from Salah, who had played a one-two
with Georginio Wijnaldum.
