The Windows flaw exists in core elements of the
operating system that are supposed to stop data
in one program interacting with anything outside
that application.
Google said it had seen evidence that criminal
hackers had found a way to make attack code jump
from Chrome into other applications to help them
compromise a machine.
A patch has been produced for Chrome and users
should ensure that they have updated their
browser to close the loophole, said Google
engineer Justin Schuh.
"Seriously, update your Chrome installs... like
right this minute," he tweeted.
The serious nature of the flaw in Chrome meant
the software had to be shut down and re-started
for the patch to take effect, he added.
