Head of Waymo's Lidar team Simon Verghese said
that his company, which has been developing
the technology since 2011, had three different
types of Lidar systems.
Initially, it will offer one Lidar unit -
dubbed Laser Bear Honeycomb - to select
partners. 
The sensor is used around the bumper of Waymo's
self-driving vehicles and has a wide field of
view.
"Offering this Lidar to partners helps spur the
growth of applications outside of self-driving
cars and also propels our business forward," Mr
Verghese said.
"We can scale our autonomous technology faster,
making each sensor more affordable through
economies of scale."
